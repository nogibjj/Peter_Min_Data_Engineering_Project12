# Peter_Min_Data_Engineering_Project12


This is the README for my Mini Project 12, Dockerized Python Applications for the IDS706 - Data Engineering Systems class at Duke University.

## Overview
The idea of this project is to gain an understanding of common Docker commands and apply Docker to package an existing Flask-based Python application and push it to DockerHub remotely.
